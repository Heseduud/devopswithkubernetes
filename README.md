## Parts

Documentation on how parts are arranged

### Part 1

Exercises submitted in individual folders (with the exception of 1.3 and 1.4, which are in folders 1.1 and 1.2). Individual folders were a bad idea, will be using the same "main-folders" for parts 2 and onward with commits differentiating exercises.
