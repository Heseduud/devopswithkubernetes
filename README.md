## Parts

Documentation on how parts are arranged

### Part 1

Exercises submitted in individual folders (with the exception of 1.3 and 1.4, which are in folders 1.1 and 1.2). Individual folders were a bad idea, will be using the same "main-folders" for parts 2 and onward with commits differentiating exercises.

### Part 2

Commits from d142b0dd9a1d8d0459927837b425e5a976e41cc8 to 5ae0e7d72d497c95d84c2cb565779278bb6adb13. See: https://github.com/Heseduud/devopswithkubernetes/commits/main
