Arguing for rancher vs openshift

Rancher:
	- Seems really easy to install (atleast for AWS and GKE in quickstart guide)
	- Faster installation (according to https://www.kloia.com/blog/openshift-vs-rancher)
	- 100% open source
	- Easy-to-read guides open for all

OpenShift:
	- Vendor-lock
	- "Openshift is reported to favor its own tools&practices"
	- IBM product (yuck)
